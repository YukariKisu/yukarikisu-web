      <p>Wind is invisible, yet always present.</p>
      <p>Sometimes it lashes out as a storm; other times, it wraps around us as a gentle breeze.</p>
      <p>We often overlook it — but I wanted to give shape to this unseen force, 
        to remind us of the quiet kindness and vastness of the earth.</p>
      <p>When the wind touches you, the scarf softly wraps around your shoulder, 
        and a subtle flame flickers deep within the earring 
        — like a warōsoku, its large, calm flame capturing the presence of what cannot be seen.</p>

      <h3>The Scarf</h3>
      <p>A soft structure that quietly comes to life each time it senses the wind 
         —gently wrapping around the body, as if to hold you close.</p>
      <h3>The Earrings</h3>
      <p>A second sensory device that sways faintly beside your ear, subtly echoing the presence of the breeze.</p>
      <h3>The Wind Sensor</h3>
      <p>A tiny mediator that perceives the invisible wind, breathing life into the scarf and earrings with every signal it sends.</p>

      <p>The wind sensor quietly detects the flow of air.
         The scarf receives this signal and softly wraps around the shoulder —
         allowing the wearer to feel the wind on their skin.</p>
      <p>The earring responds with a flickering flame deep within —
         letting those nearby see the presence of the wind.</p>

      <h3>The Spirit of 万の神 <br>(Yorozu no Kami)</h3>
      <p>In Japan, there is a long-held belief that divinity resides in all things in nature 
        — a worldview known as Yorozu no Kami, the idea that countless deities dwell in every aspect of the natural world. 
        Trees, grasses, the sky, mountains — and even the wind.</p>
      <p>This sensibility sees beauty and meaning even in the invisible, 
        a feeling deeply woven into our daily lives and aesthetic values.</p>
      <p>It is also a kind of wisdom: 
         born from living in a land shaped by natural disasters, 
         where nature is revered as divine — not controlled, but lived with in quiet respect.</p>
      <p>This is not a logic of efficiency,
         but a quiet spirituality that gently stays close to things that cannot be fully explained.</p>

      <h3>Japanese Sensibility toward Darkness and Light</h3>
      <p>In traditional Japanese culture, beauty is not found in what is fully illuminated, 
        but in what is gently veiled — in the interplay of shadow and light. </p>
      <p>Rather than banishing darkness, we embraced it.
         Flickering candles and paper lanterns did not brighten every corner.
         Instead, they allowed shadows to live, creating depth, nuance, and silence.</p>
      <p>And it was within this subtle dance of light and dark that we found beauty.</p>
      <p>This idea — that beauty lies not in the object itself,
         but in the space and ambiguity between things —
         has shaped the foundation of Japanese aesthetics.</p>

      <h3>美は物体にあるのではなく、</h3>
      <h3>物体と物体との作り出す陰翳のあや、明暗にあると考える。</h3>
      <h3>— 陰翳礼讃（谷崎潤一郎）</h3>
      <span class="term-explained">“We find beauty not in the thing itself,
       but in the patterns of shadows, the light and the darkness,
       that one thing against another creates.”<br>— In Praise of Shadows, Junichiro Tanizaki</span>

      <h3>Warōsoku — Traditional Japanese Candle</h3>
      <p>The flame of a warōsoku is more than just fire.
         It rises slowly through a thick core, melting the wax as it breathes—
         as if it were alive.</p>
      <p>When the wind touches it,
         the flame sways gently but deeply,
         turning invisible air currents into something we can see.</p>
      <P>This flame is born from the hazé tree.
         The hazé tree (Japanese wax tree) is traditionally used to make warōsoku,
         producing a slow-burning, odorless flame.</P>
      <p>Its wax is warm and slightly sticky.
         It catches fire easily, but burns slowly, calmly.
         No smoke, no scent—just stillness.</p>
      <p>And in that stillness, the presence of wind becomes more vivid.
         The flame speaks in flickers.</p>
      <p>I wanted to hold that quiet whisper of wind—
         right beside the ear.</p>
